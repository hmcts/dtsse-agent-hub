/**
 * Waits for the deployment under test to be routable before any spec runs.
 *
 * `helm upgrade --wait` returns when the pod is Ready, which is not the same as Traefik having a healthy backend
 * for the hostname; the pipeline updates DNS and starts the suite seconds later, and until the edge has an
 * endpoint it answers 502 or 503. Waiting once here rather than through Playwright's `retries` is deliberate:
 * retries re-run a spec within seconds, so every attempt lands inside the same outage.
 *
 * POLLS LIVENESS, not readiness and not a page. `/health/liveness` runs no check at all — see `src/health/probe.ts`
 * — so a 200 from it means precisely "a request reached this process and it answered", which is the one thing being
 * waited for. A page would make the gate wait on the database as well.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT DO is notice a pod that dies later, because it runs once and then the suite owns the
 * deployment. A 502 partway through a run is therefore NOT this gate failing to wait long enough, and reaching for
 * a longer deadline will not help: look for a restarting container first. `kubectl get pod` showing a non-zero
 * restart count, or `lastState.terminated`, names the cause in one line — see the `dev*` resource keys in
 * `charts/dtsse-github-metrics/values.yaml` for the instance of this that cost several builds.
 *
 * BOUNDED AND LOUD. A deployment that never becomes routable is a real failure and must not be waited on for the
 * length of the job, so the gate gives up after `DEADLINE_MS` and throws with the last thing it saw. It does not
 * swallow the outage — it reports it as itself rather than as an unrelated assertion three layers down.
